<h1>what I have been doing lately</h1>  

    <p id= "home">I have been working on are new home, pulling weeds, working on the garden. mostly just outdoor stuff. but I also have been playing outside. <a href="#outside">why I like outside.</a> I read a lot of books like the <a href= "#book">rangers apprentice series</a> we do board games,<a href= "#hockey"> hockey</a>, knee hockey cook, bake and... that is about it.</p><p id= "war"><h1>my favorite movie</h1>      

 <p id= "star-wars">my favorite movie is star wars (don't worry I wont do spoilers) <strong><em>"rise of skywalker"</em></strong> it is an epic movie featuring <em> rey, kylo ren, Finn, Poe, emperor palpatine, chewbacca, and lando calrissian.</em> it is a battle between the light side and the dark. there are a couple new character's. but I wont say any more just in case you didn't watch it.</p><img id= "starwars" src= "https://d13ezvd6yrslxm.cloudfront.net/wp/wp-content/images/EJ6E5hXXkAAdzeq.jpg" alt= "starwars poster">  <h1 id="outside">why I like outside</h1> 

   <p>outside is one of those things where you let your imagination run wild and free. you can make a fort out of sticks and leaves. sword fights with sticks, hide and seek. and if you live in the city well... I don't know what to do besides go to a local park. we own seven acres of land and it is pretty cool to explore. you can create a hideout with your friends. make maps, ambush friends. maybe scare them by jumping out of a bush and scream. or you could climb a tree, and get to the tipy top. play games with your friends like, red light green light, what time is it Mr fox, or tag. maybe if you have something like a scooter, bike, rip-stick, or other things that you can ride, then ride them on your driveway, grass, dirt road, or a road.<a href="https://morningchores.com/fun-backyard-activities/">other activities to do</a> </p><h1 id= "book">my favorite book</h1>    

     <p>it is the rangers apprentice series which is an amazing book series full of different battles and war. it my be a little gory and with some swearing but other than that it is good to read. it starts off in medieval times where a boy named will started in a ward (which in the book is an orphanage) and becomes a ranger with there shadowy ways. a ranger is a man who's job is to blend in and hide extremely well and warn the king about danger. and now will is one of them. going into battles times that are near death for him and his friends. so I would highly recommend it. it has 11 books in the series the <strong>ruins of gorlan, the burning bridge, icebound land, battle for skandia, sorcerer of the north, sedge of macinaw,  eraks ransom, kings of clonmel, halts peril, the emperor of nihon-ja, and the lost story's.</strong> it is also followed by the royal ranger series where he now has an apprentice of his own and it is much harder than he expected</p>
